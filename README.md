# PaulG to Kindle

Hackers and Painters was amazing, but I wanted to read the rest of Paul's essays on my Kindle. I couldn't find a way to do this, so I wrote a script to convert the essays to epub format.

Make sure you have pandoc installed.

    `brew install pandoc`

Then run the script:

    `npm i && npm run generate`

Either email the generated `paul_graham_essays.epub` file to your Kindle email address as an attachment OR send to your kindle from [amazon.com/sendtokindle](https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle).

3. Click on the `Settings` tab
